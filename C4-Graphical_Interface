 X Windows System is loaded as one of the final steps in boot process. Often times its called X , a service called the display manager keeps track of the display being provided and loads the X server so called because it provides graphical services to applications , sometimes called X client. The display manager also handles graphical logins and starts the sppropriate desktop environment after user logs in. 
 				X is rather old software , it dates back to mid-1980's and as such it has certain deficiencies on Mordern systems for example with security and its been stretched rather far from its orignial purpose.
 				Newer system known as "Weyland" is superscceeding it and is default display system for Fedora , REL-8 and other recent distribution. It looks like X to the user its quite different but under the hood.
