5> LOCATING ALPPLICATIONS

		In general executable program and scripts should live in:
			"/bin" or "/usr/bin" or "sbin" or "/usr/sbin"
			or
			/opt
			or
			/usr/local/bin and /usr/local/sbin
			
		or in a directory in user's account space such as
			/home/student/bin 	
	
	One way to locate programs is to employe the which utility fro eg. to,locate where diff program resides on the file system.
			
		$ which diff /usr/bin/diff  (diff is just a file name use can use firefox , snap anything)
	
	if which doesn't find the program where is the good alternative because it looks for packages in a broader range of system directories
		
		$ whereis diff      (to locate the binary or manual of file)
